        <p class="first">HTML, HyperText Markup Language, gives content structure and meaning by defining that content as, for example, headings, paragraphs, or images. <br> 
        CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a presenting language created to style the appearance of content-using. for example, fonts or colors</p>
        <p class="second">The two languages-HTML and CSS-are independent of one another and should remain that way. Css should not be written inside of an HTML document and vice versa. As a rule. HTML will always represent content, and CSS will always represent the appearance of that content</p>
